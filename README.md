## What is Pagepipe?

Pagepipe brings the power of pipes to the web. Use it on the command line to stream the output of a process to any browser (well, except for IE since it doesn't support EventSource). It works great on Windows, Mac and Linux/Unix machines.  

The full documentation along with options and example usage can be found at [dougmart.in/projects/pagepipe](http://dougmart.in/projects/pagepipe).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install -g pagepipe
```

*npm is a builtin CLI when you install Node.js*

## Sample Usage

```bash
$ someprocess | pagepipe
```
This sends  the output of someprocess to [http://localhost:10371/](http://localhost:10371/) (10371 is the default port).  Pagepipe will terminate when the output is complete and the first web client consumes the page.

```bash
$ someprocess | pagepipe -p 80 -z
```
This sends  the output of someprocess to [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) (the -p option sets the port).  Pagepipe will not terminate (the -z option sets it to zombie mode) and multiple web clients can load the page to see the same output. 
```bash
$ someprocess | pagepipe -p 80 -z -n 10
```
This sends the last 10 lines of output of someprocess to [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) (the -n option sets the number of lines). The 10 lines are held in a buffer and if someprocess emits more lines after a web client connects those lines will also be appended on the page.  The -n option is very useful to limit memory usage if you have a source process that generates a lot of output over a long span of time such as tailing a log.

```bash
$ secretprocess | pagepipe -p 80 -z -a foo/bar
```
This sends the output of secretprocess to [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) and requires the viewer to enter the username of "foo" and password of "bar" to view the contents.

```bash
$ pagepipe -z -t "My Status" -o > status.log; ngrok 10371
```
This sends anything you type in your terminal/console/cmd window to a globally viewable url generated by [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and to status.log (using the -o option to pipe stdin to stdout).  The page title and header text also change from the default ("pagepipe") to "My Status".  When anyone asks "What's up?" just send them the url.
